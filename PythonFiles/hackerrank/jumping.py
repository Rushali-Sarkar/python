#Sequentially numbered clouds that can be thunderhead or cumulus clouds
# To play erith is given an array of clouds C  and an energy level e = 100
# she uses e = 1 to jump of size k
# she jumps to cloud  c[(i + k) % n]
# if she lands on a thunder cloud her energy decreases by 2 units
# n = number of clouds 
# k = size of jump
